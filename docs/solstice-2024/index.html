    <section>
        <h2 class="text-center">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We're gathering as a family on the solstice at my place in Albion.
            The date will be the 20th, which is a Friday, unless the weather interferes, in which case we will pivot to the 21st or cancel the whole event.
            The time will be after dark, which starts approximately 5pm.
            But it's a Friday and folks are traveling from the Treasure Valley, so plan is to hold the primary event at 8pm MT.
        </p>
        <p>
            224 N Main St
            Albion, ID 83311
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary event will be a sharing under the winter sky around a fire, with hot drinks.
            We'll take turns sharing our stories until we're all done or frozen.
            One story each. Approximately 15 attendees. Dress for the season.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there (and before while we wait for everyone to arrive), food, games, company.
            All on a day that is chosen by the progression of time itself (in this case the solar cycle), not our schedules or Pope Gregory XIII.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-center">Warnings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reiterating here: the event is subject to the weather, but also cannot be rescheduled away from the solstice.
                Having my family risk their lives driving in the snow runs counter to the whole concept.
                So does choosing a date that does not align with the solar cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please plan to stow your phone/tablet/cybernetics for the evening.
                Including cameras.
                I won't be draconian about it, but this is not the time, not the place.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're old enough to understand the idea of the story to share and you choose to participate, you will be expected to share.
                This isn't to make anyone uncomfortable, it's actually the opposite.
                No spectators. You're welcome to keep warm inside if you're not game.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-center">Story to Share</h3>
        <p>
            Imagine you're Bilbo, returned from the Lonely Mountain. Or Phileas Fogg fresh off the train.
            A Norse hero stepping off the boat from Constantinople. Columbus. Lewis. Clark. Ernest Shackleton.
            You're surrounded by your family. A wealth of experience behind you.
            What story from your adventures do you tell first?
        </p>

        <p>
            That's the story to share. It doesn't have to be grand. It doesn't have to be long.
            It doesn't even have to be a story. An anecdote, a moment in time, a life lesson. That special memory.
            The only requirement (beyond the practicality of a bunch of people standing around in the cold) is that the story is yours.
            A story only you can tell, because it is your own. Yours to share. Yours to <i>choose</i> to share.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having shared it, now it's in all of us. A piece of you, multiplied in all of us.
            Each of our stories added into the makeup of everyone else present.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-center">What to Bring</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your story to share</li>
            <li>Warm clothing - we will be outdoors for a bit</li>
            <li>Board/card games you want to play</li>
            <li>Alcohol if that's your jam (I'll only have what I need for the hot drinks/food)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Staying the night</h3>
        <p>
            Quarters will be cramped, but I think I can get most people in.
            I have one room for the Corrieas, one for the Petersons, one for the Romes, one for Abby, and a large room in the basement for the kiddos (I'll be on the couch upstairs).
            Arrangements from there will be ad-hoc, but can probably be made to work given enough headsup.
            More than space to sleep, I'd wager the biggest issue will be a lack of hot water to shower.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a motel in town here, let me know if you intend to overnight but don't think the space here will work and I'll get reservations there.
        </p>
        <p>
            My plan is to have a bed for everyone, please let me know if you can bring an air mattress/sheets/things like that.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Towel if planning to shower here</li>
            <li>Dog food and bowls if applicable</li>
            <li>Coffee if that's your jam (there is a coffee shop in town)</li>
            <li>Typical overnighting gear e.g. hygiene kit, bedclothes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Local Attractions</h4>
        <p>
            Weather permitting, there are a few things to do down here.
            Primarily, Pomerelle ski resort is 20 minutes from my house.
            City of Rocks is about 40 minutes away.
            Can't be certain, but I'd wager there will be some trails to snowshoe by that time as well.
            Plus the town should be open. On Saturday, at least.

        <h2 class="text-center">Menu</h2>
        My objective is to provide food for everyone, dinner and breakfast for those staying the night.
        We have a variety of dietary requirements, let me know if I missed a combination in the list below.
        Goal is everyone has something to enjoy. Without tearing up their guts.
