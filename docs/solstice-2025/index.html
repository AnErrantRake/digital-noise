    <section>
        <h2 class="text-center">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We're gathering as a family on the solstice at my place in Albion.
            The date will be December 21st, unless the weather interferes.
            The primary event will be after dark, so sometime after 5pm.
            You are more than welcome to come down earlier, just let me know so I'm sure to be around.
        </p>
        <p>
            224 N Main St
            Albion, ID 83311
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary event will be a sharing under the winter sky around a fire, with hot drinks.
            We'll take turns sharing our stories until we're all done or frozen.
            One story each. Dress for the season.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before and after we'll have food, games, just general being together as a family. A full spread for breakfast in the morning.
            All on a day that is chosen by the progression of time itself (in this case the solar cycle), not our schedules or Pope Gregory XIII.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-center">Warnings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reiterating here: the event is subject to the weather, but also cannot be rescheduled away from the solstice.
                Having my family risk their lives driving in the snow runs counter to the whole concept.
                So does choosing a date that does not align with the solar cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please plan to stow your phone/tablet/cybernetics for the evening.
                Including cameras.
                I won't be draconian about it, but this is not the time, not the place.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're old enough to understand the idea of the story to share and you choose to participate, you will be expected to share.
                This isn't to make anyone uncomfortable, it's actually the opposite.
                No spectators. You're welcome to keep warm inside if you're not game.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-center">Story to Share/homework</h3>
        <p>
            Imagine you're Bilbo, returned from the Lonely Mountain. Or Phileas Fogg fresh off the train.
            A Norse hero stepping off the boat from Constantinople. Columbus. Lewis. Clark. Ernest Shackleton.
            You're surrounded by your family. A wealth of experience behind you.
            What story from your adventures do you tell first?
        </p>

        <p>
            That's the story to share. It doesn't have to be grand. It doesn't have to be long.
            It doesn't even have to be a story. An anecdote, a moment in time, a life lesson. That special memory.
            The only requirement (beyond the practicality of a bunch of people standing around in the cold) is that the story is yours.
            A story only you can tell, because it is your own. Yours to share. Yours to <i>choose</i> to share.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having shared it, now it's in all of us. A piece of you, multiplied in all of us.
            Each of our stories added into the makeup of everyone else present.
            A little light to bring in the dawn.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-center">What to Bring</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your story to share</li>
            <li>Warm clothing - we will be outdoors for a bit</li>
            <li>Board/card games you want to play</li>
            <li>Towel if planning to shower here</li>
            <li>Dog food and bowls if applicable</li>
            <li>Typical overnighting gear e.g. hygiene kit, bedclothes</li>
            <li>Probably chairs, maybe tables, will need to coordinate once we have a headcount</li>
            <li><b>(new!)</b> Tupperware/food storage - there will be leftovers</li>
            <li><b>(new!)</b> A book special to your family to add to the host's library - one per family</li>
            <li><b>(new!)</b> Probably some sort of food for the dinner, will need to coordinate once we have a headcount</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Addendum</h3>
        <p>
            Quarters will be cramped, but I think I can get most people in. If enough people RSVP I'll plan to reserve the AirBnB up the hill from my house. There's also a motel in town.
        </p>
        <p>
            Doggos are more than welcome, but we'll want to coordinate, make sure all the dogs get along. We had some issues last year so I'd like to try and sleep them in one room, but I don't have a dog so happy to take suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I haven't had a little one at my house yet, so I'd appreciate some parental eyes/suggestions for child-proofing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all of you have been to my place. It's not required, but I recommend coming down in something that can get around in the snow.
            Might not be an issue depending on how the winter goes, but I'm a few hundred feet off of the road that gets consistently plowed.
        </p>
        <h4>Local Attractions</h4>
        <p>
            Weather permitting, there are a few things to do down here.
            Primarily, Pomerelle ski resort is 20-30 minutes from my house.
            City of Rocks and Castle Rock parks are about 40 minutes away.
            Weather dependent, there will be some trails to snowshoe by that time as well.
            The town is usually only open on Saturday, although I've seen hours shift a bit this year. Coffee, pizza, mercantile. Saloon down the hill.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the skies are clear, it will be fantastic star viewing.
            It's a new moon, so very dark, and the state park on the other side of the mountain is an International Dark Sky Place - we have very little light pollution.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-center">Known Dietary Concerns (groups)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No eggs, no dairy</li>
            <li>No grains</li>
            <li>No meat (vegetarian)</li>
            <li>No alcohol (kids)</li>
            <li>Picky kid</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Let me know if you aren't covered by one of the items above. I'd very much like to have something for everyone that's *real* food, not just a drink or dessert.
        </p>
        <p>
            Either way we'll want to coordinate on food.
